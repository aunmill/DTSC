<!-- I decided to go with the overall model. It had the lowest AIC (not by much), the most fitting Mallow's CP by far, and similar R^2 as the other variables even though it adds another predictor(which usually makes R^2 go up). None of these models are particularly good in my opinion, which was suprising to me. The model is statistically significant. I expected average drinks to correlate highly in magnitude with physhealth2. -->
